### Pony/camel Breeding

- Ponies/camels can be male or female. Check its gender right clicking on them.
- Each animal has its own velocity forward, velocity backward and acceleration. You can read its characteristics with the format "1/1/1" where the numbers represent these 3 characteristics.

- You can breed any animal even if you do not own it. But the owner of the babies will be the mother's owner.
- The male germ is unlimited but a female pony/camel only can give birth 5 babies máx. After those 5 babies, the mommy turn into infertile.

#### The method of breeding
- 1/2/3 means a velocity of 1 for forward, 2 for backward and 3 is the acceleration. So the first number of the triad is the most important.
- Naturally spawned ponies/camels have speed statistics from 1/1/1 to 4/4/4. This means that spawned ponies/camels are slow animals (40% of the speed limit in the best case).
- The hypothetical faster pony would be a 10/10/10. You have to breed the natural ponies/camels to achieve faster ones.
- Keep in mind that even fast parents can procreate a slow child. So you'll have to breed several times to get an optimal child.
- The method is to breed parents with high speed statistics to get the best descendants, then select the fastest descendants to continue breeding them. This is a very slow process. Be patient.
