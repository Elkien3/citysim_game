	<h1> About The Mod </h1>
	<p> Ever wanted to make and Drink your own beer. This mod adds some plants into mine test as well as adding the stages of making beer, as well 
	as not forgetting the beer itself. We are planning on adding a lot more to this mod such as more beers, ales and even cider. Stay tune for new 
	updates which are coming soon. </p>
