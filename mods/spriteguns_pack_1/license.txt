license info here is also a WIP, most sounds came from pixabay or were processed from the original sfx 

Code: vanadiumheart (CC BY-SA 4.0)
Textures: vanadiumheart (CC BY-SA 4.0)
Sounds:
	glock21_fire.ogg, mac10_fire.ogg, serbu_fire.ogg by vanadiumheart (CC BY-SA 4.0)
	
	stevens94a_charge.ogg and stevens94a_fire.ogg need to either be replaced, or investigated
	as they were obtained from pixabay. According to their licensing sounds must be transformed
	in order to distribute, though these were not edited aside from cutting the audio.
